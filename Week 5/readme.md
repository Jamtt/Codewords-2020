# Week 5 | Grab Your Popcorn
Exciting start of this weeks class because we got to share what we've been working on for Brief 2. It was very really amazing on what people have created in the span of 4 weeks, so many great ones! One that stuck to me was the Minecraft group with the scene of Jhonny laying down on the bed. I'm sure this horror story is planted in my head now :D Now that we've created these re-readings, I think that it elevated the story of House of Leaves.

## Brief 3
The second half of this weeks class was to discuss the objectives of brief 3, and the milestones we will use to help achieve our goals. group discussion on reading - deep information - we chose to analyse Other Spaces by Michel Foucault.

 The first milestone will be to choose a text of critical theory on language and new media. You worked in small groups to make summaries of many of the texts in the reader to help you make your choice

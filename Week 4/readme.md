# Week 4

## p5.js
Week 4 was focused on how to introduce typography to our sketch. The functions we used were the preload and the loadFont, as well as related type functions to position words on the page. Then Karen then taught us the spinning movement that is linked to the mouse coordinates of mouseX and mouseY.

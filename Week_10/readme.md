# Week 10 | Milestone

This week we had a short and quick presentation of our code-in-progress. This was another milestone for us to show what we have been working on. It was also an opportunity to ask help and offer some advices to other stuents. Click [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rqOlmfpCzXC9kA_vBeLOcTpdxCvWeo4zsiNa4uiDHTY/edit#gid=0) to see our spreadsheet that compiled our code-in-progress, a screenshot of our hero image, link to our github and a working sketch.

2. We revisited the demo sketches from the semester which are available on my gitHub and unpacked a few issues that were still unclear. You're encouraged to go back to these 'basics' if you are feeling unsure about how to move forward with the more complex sketches.

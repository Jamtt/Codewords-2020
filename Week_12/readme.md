# Week 12 | The End
The night before our last class, I had the time to think about what I would name this project. The word mirage came into my mind as I was thinking about the concept of mirrors. Mirage means an optical illusion caused by atmospheric condition or an unrealistic hope or wish that cannot be achieved. I felt like my concept of heterotopias and mirrors is well suited to the definition of a mirage. So I named it Mirage.

I also ask for some feedback from friends. They gave me assuring statements about my work and said it was 'groovy'. Also as I was writing my statement I felt that time went by so quickly and we're already in week 12! So bittersweet!

## Soft Launch
In this week we dedicated the first half of the class in making materials we needed for our major project showcase, such as animated GIFs, hero image and statements. Once we gathered all of them we had our soft launch on our major project, and it was really nice to see what everybody had done. So much amazing work and talented creative coders in this bunch. Many of us started from the basics and now they seem to be flying off the roofs with their skills! So proud of all them :) To visit our showcase website click [here!](https://simandy.github.io/codewords/)

## Reflection
Codewords has been such a great studio. Both Andy and Karen passionately taught us different ways of how we read and to code words. I was always scared of coding again since Slave to the Algorithm studio last year. Even though it was a great experience, it made me feel overwhelmed. However I didnt want to give up and I think coding is the future of design, and thus I decided that I should keep on learning about it. 

As we started this studio the first few weeks, we touched on experiencing virtual spaces since we cant physically meet each other as well. Once we jumped on this I felt like this was going to be a great studio and especially Mini Melbourne and Animal Crossing was my favorite! Not only was this a game for our learning experience, but it was also a great way to bond with each other even when we are apart.

Week by week we kept on going further into the relationship between code and words and every class I would always learn something new. With having very little amount of skills in p5.js, I would always be amazed with the amount of possibilities we could make through this platform. There were many roadblocks and challenges that I went through, making me feel frustrated at times, but at the end it was worth it. Now that I've been exposed on the countless possibilities of reading,

From Minecraft, Animal Crossing, 

For now we wanted to extend our warm thanks for all your work and the wonderful conversations on modular typography, reading and technology, self-destructing AI-dungeon stories, Minecraft mayhem, animal crossing horror, lots of live coding, and so much wonderful weirdness.

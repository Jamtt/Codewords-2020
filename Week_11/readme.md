# Week 11 | Debugging

Before class I got the chance to ask some help from Jamie to further develop my project. Last week I had trouble with distorting my text with the textToPoint function on only my left canvas. Jamie helped me understand the function within my sketch. It was more complicated than I thought since I had multiple canvases working at the same time. We got to stage where the distorting on the left canvas works. However it only works once, meaning the next key typed wont work, leaving a black screen. This was a road block for me.

Thankfully Karen helped my disect the existing sketch that I worked on and got the distortion to work on every key typed! (you are amazing karen!)

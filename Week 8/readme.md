# Week 8 | My Concept Idea
explain my final idea

## Geomerative Library
When I pitched my idea to Andy and Karen, Karen mentioned how I would be able to distort my text by playing with anchor points. She then introduced me to the Geomerative library. Geomerative is a library for Processing. It extends 2D geometry operations to facilitate generative geometry. Includes a TrueType font and an SVG interpreters. This library exposes the shapes (such as vector drawings or typographies) in a more approchable way. Geomerative makes it easy to access the paths, the handles and the points, making it easy to develop generative typography and geometry pieces in Processing.

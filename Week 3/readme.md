# Week 3 | Wot is Electronic Lit?
Week 3 started with an introduction to electronic literature. We discussed on a few case studies on avatars and virtual identities like Cindy Sherman, Mariko Mori, Stelarc. Then we shared our own research on the different types of electronic literature. In class I had an interesting discussion with Andy and Karen on deepfakes. I question if deepfakes is considered an electronic literature and their answer was yes. Deepfakes are a form of artificial intelligence called deep learning to make images of fake events. However, in the context of this class, I didnt deeply researched about them as it can get very political and negative.

## AI Dungeon
As a whole class we joined AI Dungeon which is a an infinitely generated text adventure powered by deep learning. It was my first time trying out this and it was pretty chaotic and I was impressed on how fast they generated texts. Most of the students had their own ideas of what story they wanted to tell and we think it became overloaded.

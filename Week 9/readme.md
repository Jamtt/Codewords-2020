## Typing...
<img src = "week9wip.JPG">
Ive been working on creating different canvases and displyaing text on each canvas. Since I want to use the keyTyped function, I tried to figure out how a sentence would appear if the user types a letter.

I've gathered the words and phrases of each letters that can be typed by the user. These words and phrases are linked to the idea of a utopia and heterotopia. So far the list is this:
A – absence
B – 
C – counteraction
D – 
E – external space
F – functions
G – glass
H – heterotopias
I – I see myself there where I am not
J – joint experience
K – 
L – look
M - mirror
N – No real place
O – own visibility
P – places
Q – 
R – reality
S – shadow
T – 
U – utopias
V – virtual space
W – 
X – 
Y – 
Z - 

Karen got the chance to help me figure out how to flip a canvas in p5.js. 

## Typeface
Then I have considered the typeface that would be used for my final project.

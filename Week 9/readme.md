# Week 9 | Research
This week I started looking for inspiration on how I can express my concept. I first went to Open Processing and searched on the different possibilites of outcomes on typography. These are few examples I found on unreadable text (distortion and blur):

Since Open Processing is written in Java, I would need to translate the functions into Javascript and Karen and Andy shared a great link that would help me do this.

As I keep on digging for inspiration, the p5js website had some sketch examples that were great on mirroring and flipped canvases. This helped me figure out how to flip and canvas by scaling it.

## Typing...
<img src = "week9wip.JPG">
Ive been working on creating different canvases and displyaing text on each canvas. Since I want to use the keyTyped function, I tried to figure out how a sentence would appear if the user types a letter.

I've gathered the words and phrases of each letters that can be typed by the user. These words and phrases are linked to the idea of a utopia and heterotopia. So far the list is this:

A – absence

B – Believe

C – counteraction

D – Direct of inverted

E – External space

F – Functions

G – Glass

H – Heterotopias

I – I see myself 

J – Joint experience

K – 

L – Look

M - Mirror

N – No real place

O – Own visibility

P – Placeless place

Q – 

R – reality

S – Shadow

T – There where I am not

U – Utopias

V – Virtual space

W – 

X – 

Y – 

Z - 


Karen got the chance to help me figure out how to flip a canvas in p5.js. 

## Typeface
Then I have considered the typeface that would be used for my final project.
